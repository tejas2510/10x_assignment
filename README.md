## 🔹 1. Depth Data Extraction
- Depth images are decoded from ROS 2 `sensor_msgs/Image` byte messages in the `.db3` file.  
- Each image is converted into a floating-point depth map (in meters).  
- Metadata such as resolution, encoding, and timestamps are parsed for each frame.

---

## 🔹 2. Point Cloud Generation
Using pinhole camera geometry, each depth map is projected into 3D coordinates.

Focal lengths are computed from the horizontal field of view (60°):

\[
f_x = \frac{W}{2 \tan(\text{FOV}/2)}, \quad f_y = \frac{H}{2 \tan(\text{FOV}/2)}
\]

Each pixel \((u, v)\) is mapped to 3D space as:

\[
x = (u - c_x) \frac{z}{f_x}, \quad y = (v - c_y) \frac{z}{f_y}
\]

## 🔹 3. Outlier Removal
- Conservative z-clipping based on **median** and **IQR** removes depth outliers and sensor noise.  
- Ensures stable and robust plane fitting.

---

## 🔹 4. Plane Detection (RANSAC)
- Iterative RANSAC is applied to extract planar surfaces from 3D points.  
- Each plane is represented as:

\[
n \cdot x + d = 0
\]

where **n** is the unit normal vector.  
- Plane normals are refined using **PCA** on inliers.  
- Up to **6 dominant planes** are detected per frame.

---

## 🔹 5. Contiguous Face Extraction
For each detected plane:
- Inlier points are projected back to 2D image space.  
- **Morphological close–open operations** and **connected components** isolate the largest contiguous region.  
- The **Convex Hull** (`scipy.spatial.ConvexHull`) defines the face boundary for area estimation.

---

## 🔹 6. Visible Area Computation
- The 3D area of the planar hull is computed by projecting points onto two principal basis vectors \((b_1, b_2)\).  
- The **shoelace formula** is then applied on the 2D projection:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) \right|
\]

---

## 🔹 7. Plane Scoring and Selection
Each detected plane is scored using a weighted composite metric:
- Pixel area  
- Hull solidity  
- Center proximity  
- Normal facing the camera  

The plane with the highest score is selected as the **dominant visible face**.

---

## 🔹 8. Normal Angle Estimation
The **normal angle** is computed between the plane normal and the camera optical axis:

\[
\theta = \cos^{-1}(-n_z)
\]

---

## 🔹 9. Rotation Axis Estimation
- Plane normals across frames are aligned towards the camera.  
- Differences between consecutive normals are analyzed using **SVD** to extract the **dominant rotation axis**.  
- A **cross-product validation** ensures consistency across frames.  
- The result is a normalized **3D rotation vector** in camera coordinates.
